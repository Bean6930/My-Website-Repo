    <h1>Audrey Powell | About</h1>
    <p class="aboutparagraph">
      Audrey Powell is a US-born photographer based in Ohio. She specializes in nature and wildlife photography but is interested in expanding her skill range. While growing up with a large family of seven, her home was always crowded. To get away
      from the chaos she would go outside, watch the sunset, and just enjoy nature. It was the beauty she saw and the enjoyment she experienced that led her to start pursuing photography, at first with a simple phone camera than with a Canon EOS 10D
      camera she received as a gift. Now as a high school student her only goal with photography is not to gain money but to share the beauty she sees with others who might not be able to see it.
